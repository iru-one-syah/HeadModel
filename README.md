# **Raw Data for Creating a Custom Dummy Head**

This repository provides the raw 3D data (51 unprocessed OBJ files) derived from the **BodyParts3D Project**. These files are intended for those who wish to create a similar dummy head with their own customizations.

If you'd like to see how these files can be modified and used to create a dummy head, check out our modified version and the associated demonstration video:

- **Video Demo:** [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/5bxazr6eseA)

The files provided here are the unprocessed versions of the data, filtered and organized to make customization easier.
